This is an open explanatory analysis into Eastern Europe's dataset provided by the world bank.
Task: Given raw data about world statistics come up with insights about your region. Region: Eastern Europe.

THE SLOW DEATH OF EASTERN EUROPE

Methodology

First, we cleaned up the raw data by filling in missing information about our region then did outlier detection for all chosen categories using box plots.

In cleaning the data, the following countries were removed from the data set: San Marino and Andorra. This was due to the following reasons: • The two countries were too small and therefore skewed our data • They were not economically connected to our region • The two countries are not in Eastern Europe

We also removed the following data: Births attended by skilled health staff, Educational attainment among different age groups and Prevalence of underweight because other metrics provided in the data set better explained the given criterions.

Analysis

Population
The region has a total population of 125,921,885 with Poland being the most populated county (population of 37,974,826) The female population in Eastern Europe is the largest with a population percentage of 51.15%, while the male population stands at 48.85%.

The dependancy ratio is 51%. Depenancy ratio can be defined as the age population ratio of those not in the labor force of a country by depend on the working population.

Income inequality
Income inequality is best measured by the gini index. Serbia has the highest income inequality with the gini index standing at 40% while Slovenia has the lowest income inequality with it’s gini index standing at 25%. We discovered that the gini index is highly correlated with poverty levels ( a correlation level of 0.57) meaning that the gini index can be used to show wich country has the highest levels in Eastern Europe.

Economy sectors
The major economic sectors are the Service sector, Industrial sector and Agricultural sectors. There is a high movement of labor from the agricultural sector to the service and industrial sectors. For this reason theres a noticeable movement of people from the rural areas to urban regions.

It was also discovered that most countries in Eastern Europe are satellite economies of Germany. This is because Germany has big auto mobile factories in most countries and also has a high presence in the service sectors offering among many other products financial and consulting services.

Health data
We analyzed the birth rates, fertility rates and death rates of Eastern Europe and discovered; The average birth and fertility rates are lower than the world averages being 10.5 and 12.1 respectively. The death rates on the other hand a higher than the world averages standing at 10.5.

World averages (Birth rate - 18.7, fertility rate - 42.5, death rate - 7.5)

Findings and conclusions

Eastern Europe's population is slowly shrinking. This can be attributed to the fact that the birth and fertility rates are low and also since the working population is moving to the west in search for better work opportunities. Countries in Eastern Europe should consider solutions and policies; could be in the form of lax immigration policies, baby bonuses or investing to improve pay and living conditions in their countries, to boost the population in these countries.
